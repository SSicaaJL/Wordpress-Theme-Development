### THEME DEVELOPMENT NOTES ###

Template files are not written from scratch. It is built from underscores(_s), https://underscores.me
It should be noted that many tags have custom classnames written by _s, and should be deleted as we are using our own classnames.

Using Bootstrap 4 framework to build our site, bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js

For icons, using free fontawesme icon library at https://fontawesome.com
